# Creating a Baseball League Database

In this project, I create a relational database (`mlb.db`) which stores information for a baseball league using SQL. Initially, relevant data is stored various csv files, each containing different information about the league:
- `appearance_type.csv`
- `game_log.csv` (not uploaded - file size contraints)
- `park_codes.csv`
- `person_codes.csv`
- `team_codes.csv`

The database created was based on the schema outlined:
